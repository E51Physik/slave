    .. note::

        The ppms needs a newÄºine '\\\\n' character as message terminator. Using
        delay between read and write operations is recommended as well.

    :ivar advisory_number: The advisory code number, a read only integer in the
        range 0 to 999.
    :ivar chamber: The configuration of the sample chamber. Valid entries are
        'seal', 'purge seal', 'vent seal', 'pump' and 'vent', where

        * 'seal' seals the chamber immediately.
        * 'purge seal' purges and then seals the chamber.
        * 'vent seal' ventilates and then seals the chamber.
        * 'pump' pumps the chamber continuously.
        * 'vent' ventilates the chamber continuously.

    :ivar field: The magnetic field configuration, represented by the following
        tuple *(<field>, <rate>, <approach mode>, <magnet mode>)*, where

        * *<field>* is the magnetic field setpoint in Oersted with a
          resolution of 0.01 Oersted. The min and max fields depend on the
          magnet used.
        * *<rate>* is the ramping rate in Oersted/second with a resolution of
          0.1 Oersted/second. The min and max values depend on the magnet
          used.
        * *<approach mode>* is the approach mode, either 'linear',
          'no overshoot' or 'oscillate'.
        * *<magnet mode>* is the state of the magnet at the end of the
          charging process, either 'persistent' or 'driven'.

    :ivar temperature: The temperature configuration, a tuple consisting of
        *(<temperature>, <rate>, <approach mode>)*, where

        * *<temperature>* The temperature settpoint in kelvin in the range 1.9
          to 350.
        * *<rate>* The sweep rate in kelvin per minute in the range 0 to 20.
        * *<approach mode>* The approach mode, either 'fast' or 'no overshoot'.
