slave Changelog
===============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each slave release.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Note: This release breaks backwards compatibility.

 - Changed the notation of a `connection` to `transport`. This name is more
   widely used, see e.g. twisted, or asyncio.
 - Removed the direct usage of the transport object in device driver methods.
   Now almost all methods use the `InstrumentBase._query()` and
   `InstrumentBase._write()` methods.

   There are only a few exceptions:

    * `slave.srs.sr830.SR830.trace()`
    * `slave.srsr.sr830.SR830.snap()`
    * `slave.srs.sr850.MarkList.active()`

 - Renamed `slave.core.InstrumentBase._cfg` attribute to `_protocol` and in all
   dependant cases.

Changes to the `slave.core` module:

 - The `InstrumentBase.transport`attribute was renamed to `_transport` to be
   more consistent. This avoids shadowing of possible commands and show the
   intent that in general the transport should not be used directly.

Changes to the `slave.lakeshore.ls340` module:

 - The `slave.lakeshore.ls340.Curve.delete()` method now raises a
   `RuntimeError` when called on a read-only curve.
 - The `slave.lakeshore.ls340.LS340._factory_defaults()` method does not take
   the boolean `confirm` argument anymore. The trailing underscore should be
   warning enough that you know what you're doing.
 - The `slave.lakeshore.ls340.LS340.columnx` attributes are replaced by a tuple
   of column instance.

Changes to the `slave.lakeshore.ls370` module:

 - Implemented the missing relay commands `LS370.low_relay` and
   `LS370.high_relay`.
